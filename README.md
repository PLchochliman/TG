# TG
 Try of implement mechanics of TG into simple program, as bot for Discord.
the things you need:
Requests, Discord.py, Excel, psycopg2, creating your own token for discord Bot, add it your bot to server, and probably handbook of Trigger Discipline (to understand the rules, program is for someone who read at least basic rules of Trigger Discipline).
optionally you can run SQL server and convert database from Excel to SQL  (Converter included), and switch database to SQL. For this you will need an PostgreSQL client.
